# Student Information Manager with JavaFX

Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub repository. In this project, I've crafted a simple CRUD (For my Info Management Class) application using Java with JavaFX. 
It's tailored for managing student information, offering features like user authentication, data entry, and a nifty table view to make everything clear.

## What's Inside?

### 1. Secure Access
- **Login:** Get access to the application securely.
- **Register:** New users can easily create an account.

### 2. Handling Student Information
- **Add (Create):** Input new student details seamlessly.
- **View (Table View):** Explore stored student data neatly using JavaFX.
- **Update:** Tweak existing information as needed.
- **Delete:** Bid farewell to any unnecessary student records.

## Tech Stack:

- **JavaFX:** This handles the stylish graphical user interface.
- **Java:** The brains behind the application logic.
- **IntelliJ IDEA:** My go-to IDE for crafting and organizing the project.
- **MySQL:** A reliable database management system storing all that valuable student information.
- **MySQL Workbench:** Perfect for designing and managing the database.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a MySQL database and ensure the application is configured to connect.
3. Fire up IntelliJ IDEA and open the project.
4. Run the application locally.
5. Dive in, start entering student information, and witness the CRUD magic!
